### üòñ Why haven't you used [insert favourite language/framework/convention here]

As an open-source project most of our decisions up till now have been guided by the people writing the code and conversations with people in our community whose opinions we value and respect. Some things are by careful design after the result of lengthy discussions, others are just individual preference with few complaints to date. As we both want to encourage input from newer contributors but also want to avoid getting bogged down in circular or repetitive debates we encourage you to:

1. Start with an observation - instead of asking 'do you use redux' take a look at the `package.json` and see for yourself.
2. See if this is something we've already talked about
3. Clearly state what you believe the benefits to the project would be - simply 'because I've used it before and like it' isn't good enough! Do your research, evaluate common alternatives (in the very least google '[my awesome thought] vs X' and read the first few articles. Try to present a balanced argument for why we might want to/not want to use something.
4. Be willing to support implementation - any great idea or suggestion will have direct impact on others contributing to the project. If there is something you feel strongly about you should first create a clean, clear demo of how it would work in practice, and be willing to provide additional guidance if called upon.

## ü§ù &nbsp; Joining the team

We are always open to have more people involved. If you would like to contribute more often, we would love to welcome you to the team. Just [send a quick email](mailto:platform@onearmy.world?subject=Can%20I%20Help?)

We ask this so that we can better understand how you might fit in with the rest of the team, and maximise your contributions. From here we will then connect you to the github repository as well as slack channel which we use to handle regular communication.
